# Portfolio
The code that was uploaded to my Portfolio is one of my favorite codes I have worked on. The Java code asks the user for an input on the current Fahrenheit temperature outside. 
After the input, the code asks the user for the percentage of humidity outside. The program then gives the user an output of what the temperature feels like outside due to the humidity.
