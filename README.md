# Portfolio
The code that was uploaded to my Portfolio is one of my favorite codes I have worked on. The Java code asks the user for an input on the current Fahrenheit temperature outside. 
The code acknowledges the input from the user and is ready to ask the follow up question. After the initial input, the code then asks the user for the percentage of humidity outside. The code uses an equation given to me by my professor to calculate what the temperature outside actually feels like due to the humidity. 

Example- 
" What is the current temperature in the degree Fahrenheit?"
Input- 70
" Enter the current humidity as a percentage."
Input- 50%
" At the temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the humidity at 50% it feels like 76 degrees."
